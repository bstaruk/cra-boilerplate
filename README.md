# Brian's CRA Boilerplate

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) ([v5.0.1](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/releases/tag/v5.0.1)), with the following features added:

* basic code formatting via [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) & [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
* a modern redux implementation via [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) & [Redux-Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/)
* css-in-js with global styles and a theme via [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
